Required entitlements include a Special Use Permit (SUP) to permit residential uses in the E1 (Executive Office) zoning district; Site Plan and Architectural Review (SPAR) for construction of new residential buildings; Site Development Planning Application (SDPA) for grading and removal of vegetation; and a Vesting Tentative Map for the creation of condominium units.
Peninsula Heights, located along Campus Drive, is located on two parcels totaling 15.45 acres. The project consists 290 for-sale units and proposes to devote 10% of the 290 units to the low-income category. The proposed architectural style is contemporary and includes townhome, single-family detached, and stacked flats building arrangements. A total of 625 on-site parking spaces are proposed, which include attached garages and residential guest parking.
The applicant proposes to keep the existing emergency vehicle access (EVA) road connecting Campus Drive to 26th Avenue as an EVA. Publicly accessible improvements include a series of open parks and trails. The four existing office buildings that currently exist on the site are proposed for demolition. On December 8, 2020, the Planning Commission approved the project and adopted the Mitigated Negative Declaration by vote of 5-0.

The parking garage will provide 164 spaces for the tenants of the multi-family building and 526 public spaces. The project site consists of two city-owned parcels which served as public parking lots with a total of 235 parking spaces. 

The project utilized provisions of Assembly Bill (AB) 1763, which allows for increased building height and density for housing developments located within a half-mile of a major transit stop and offering 100 percent of the total units to lower income households.

The project, as proposed, consists of two buildings located on two parcels:

A seven-story residential building (Kiku Crossing) comprised of 225 affordable rental units at 480 E. 4th Avenue.
A five-level, above-ground parking garage (5th Avenue Garage) located at 400 E. 5th Avenue that will provide 164 spaces for the tenants of the multi-family building and 526 public spaces.

			<description><![CDATA[<div><b>name</b>: Underground Flow Equalization System (UFES) - PA18-010</div><div><b>description</b>: The City of San Mateo is implementing a series of capital projects, referred to collectively as the Clean Water Program (CWP), to replace aging wastewater infrastructure, build wet weather capacity, comply with regulatory requirements, and align with the City’s sustainability goals. In adopting the 2016 Final Program EIR for the CWP, the City Council selected the “In-System Storage Program” alternative. The Underground Flow Equalization System (UFES) project, consistent with the Council’s selected program alternative, will provide the wastewater system capacity to comply with regulations requiring prevention of sanitary system overflows.
This project consists of a concrete holding structure, pump station, diversion sewers and force main, and on odor control equipment room. These facilities would be located underground. Access hatches, an emergency backup generator, and an electrical building and vents for treated air would be located at ground level. The proposed project will provide for short-term storage of wastewater to prevent sanitary sewer overflows during wet weather. On July 17, 2017, the City Council selected the San Mateo County Event Center parking lot as the preferred location for the project. A Final Environmental Impact Report (Final EIR) has been prepared to specifically identify and analyze the anticipated environmental impacts of the Underground Flow Equalization System (UFES) project. The Final EIR includes responses to the comments received on the Draft EIR, as well as any amendments needed to the Draft EIR in response to comments. The project will require a Special Use Permit for a public service use in the “A” Agricultural District and a Site Plan & Architectural Review (SPAR) for structures and walls over six feet in height.

On September 24, 2019, the City of San Mateo Planning Commission recommended City Council approval of the Special Use Permit, Site Plan and Architectural Review and certification of the Final EIR. This included the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program and adoption of a Statement of Overriding Considerations regarding construction noise impacts. On October 21, 2019, by vote of 5-0, the City Council held a Public Hearing and adopted the Resolution to approve the City of San Mateo Underground Flow Equalization System, certify the final Environmental Impact Report, and adopt California Environmental Quality Act Findings, Statement of Overriding Considerations, and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program.
